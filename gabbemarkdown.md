# Gabbe Pond's Project-DWDD 3620-Spring 2024
Welcome to my Github Learning Project. 
I have learned... How to create a repository
I have learned... how to create a README file today on my Github 
I have learned... How to create a MARKDOWN file
## I also learned...
Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS), which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing. 
With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what youâ€™ve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. 
It also makes working with others easier. 
Groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!
### Lastly I learned...
Issues are a way to track enhancements, tasks, or bugs for your work on GitHub. 
Issues are a great way to keep track of all the tasks you want to work on for your project and let others know what you plan to work on. 
You can also use issues to tell a favorite open source project about a bug you found or a feature you think would be great to add!
